The online advertising market is huge and its size has been increasing in money,
campaigns and users. Both platforms that sell and buy space for ad placement
want to understand what is their value and more important, what will be their

and users that are target for their campaigns.

Our goal is to forecast the availability of the users in the future so we can
simulate the value of future campaigns over them.

The main problem is to predict how the future will be.
