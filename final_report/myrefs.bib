  abstract = {The diffusion of the internet has substantially modified the advertising
	industry's business models. The method of selling advertising space
	on webpages is one of the most striking innovations. Advertisements
	and, in particular, banners, are sold through the traditional cost
	per impression, but also with methods based on a visitor taking some
	specifically defined action in response to an ad. This paper examines
	the pricing strategy of web publishers operating in a market where
	they are unable to influence the price of the advertisement (cost-per-impression
	and cost-per-action). The main finding is that the distribution of
	editorial revenues between pay-per-view and pay-per-click methods
	depends on the elasticity of access and actions with respect to the
	quantity of advertising. The theoretical result is important, since
	these parameters are usually available to permit a quick analysis
	of an online consumer's behaviour. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
